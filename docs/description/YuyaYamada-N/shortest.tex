\section{Engine: Core Solver or Algorithm}
Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an approach to declarative problem solving.
ASP provides a rich language and 
is well suited for modeling combinatorial problems 
in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.
Recent improvements in the effectiveness of ASP systems
have encouraged researchers to use ASP for solving problems in diverse
areas, such as
automated planning,
constraint satisfaction,
model checking, etc.

The {\recongo} solver is an ASP-based combinatorial reconfiguration
problem solver.
{\recongo} reads a problem instance and converts it into ASP facts.
In turn, these facts are combined with a first-order encoding for
problem solving, which is subsequently solved by a general-purpose ASP
system, in our case {\clingo}.
For CoRe Challenge 2022, we develop a basic ASP encoding and some
additional hints for solving independent set reconfiguration problems.
